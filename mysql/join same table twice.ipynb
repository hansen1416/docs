    "There are numerous restrictions to what can be an indexed view. In a data warehouse setting those restrictions will make it impossible for just about every standard star join view to be an indexed view. Which is really a shame, since despite what the comments say, [materialized] indexed views are magic!\n",
    "\n",
    "As for whether joining to the same table twice is an issue, it is not. In a data warehouse you'll often find yourself joining to time and date dimensions dozens of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I was interested to see that you made the primary key on the date dimension the date itself. In my last data warehouse we ended up needing to use an INT column as the primary key, because we needed to save indeterminate dates (like 2016/1/??) where all of the date parts were not known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, when writing your views, you should always check to verify whether a LEFT JOIN will have better performance than an INNER JOIN, even if they produce the same results. Back when our data warehouse was closer to a snowflake schema, the joins were into the hundreds, and many of the views did better with all LEFT JOINs as opposed to INNER JOINs where INNER JOINs were appropriate."
