    "- A transformer consists of a stack of encoders to process an input of any arbitrary length and another stack of decoders to output the generated sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the above example, the encoder processes the input sentence and generates a representation for it. The decoder uses this representation to create an output sentence word by word. The initial representation/embedding for each word are represented by the unfilled circles. The model then aggregates information from all other words using self-attention to generate a new representation per word, represented by the filled balls, informed by the entire context. This step is then repeated multiple times in parallel for all words, successively generating new representations. Similarly, the decoder generates one word at a time, from left to right. It attends not only to the other previously created words but also to the final representations developed by the encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast to LSTMs, a transformer only performs a small, constant number of steps while applying a self-attention mechanism which directly models relationships between all words in a sentence, regardless of their respective position. As a model processes each word in an input sequence, self-attention allows the model to look at other relevant parts of the input sequence for better encoding of the word. It uses multiple attention heads which expands the modelâ€™s ability to focus on different positions regardless of their distance in the sequence."
