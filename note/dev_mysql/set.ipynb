    "- `SET` column values that consist of multiple set members are specified with members separated by commas (,). A consequence of this is that `SET` member values should not themselves contain commas.\n",
    "- A `SET` column can have a maximum of 64 distinct members.\n",
    "- Duplicate values in the definition cause a warning, or an error if strict SQL mode is enabled.\n",
    "- Trailing spaces are automatically deleted from SET member values in the table definition when a table is created.\n",
    "- When retrieved, values stored in a SET column are displayed using the lettercase that was used in the column definition. Note that SET columns can be assigned a character set and collation. For binary or case-sensitive collations, lettercase is taken into account when assigning values to the column.\n",
    "- When fequently select by `SET` value, Don't use SET because the \"select events by category\" query will be slow."
