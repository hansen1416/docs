    "Two students, Alice and Bob, sit at the same table. A teacher suspects that they communicate with each other during tests. The test consists of several multiple choice questions with single correct answer. If Alice don't know correct answer, she selects it randomly with equal probabilities. If Bob don't know correct answer and they communicate, he copies answer of Alice. If they do not communicate, he chooses answer randomly. (Student cannot believe he or she knows correct answer when it is not true.) Null hypothesis is that they do not cheat and act independently. There are 5 problems in the test for which correct answers are unknown to both students (and the teacher knows it), each problems has four possible answers. The teacher uses the following strategy: if all 5 answers to these questions coincide between students, she claims that students are cheating. Otherwise, she believes they are not cheating. Assume they are cheating in fact. What is the probability to make type I error?\n",
