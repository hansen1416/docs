    "There is a connection between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. Assume that we have an i.i.d. sample $x=(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$ from some random variable $X$ with finite variance. Consider one-sample t-test with null hypothesis $\\mathbb EX=\\mu_0$ and symmetric alternative. For simplicity, let us assume that $n$ is large enough and replace TT-distribution with standard normal distribution. Assume that one found confidence interval II for $\\mathbb EX$ with confidence level 95%. Prove that standard decision-making procedure of t-test is equivalent to the following: reject null hypothesis if and only if $\\mu_0$ does not belong to $I$. Follow the plan:\n",
