So like we have a large dice with the number of faces equal to number of characters in the alphabet, and some probabilities of getting each face depends on the language used. We just throw this dice several times, number of times equals to length of this text, and just record this text as a result of this dice rollings. Of course, it is not correct model, but it is useful model._\n",
