    "S3 is an object storage service. It can be used as shared storage via s3fs. It allows to mount a bucket via FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace interface). I have not tried it but the performance when you use S3 as a classic file system seems quite low and the read/write limitation quite high. On the other hand it's the cheapest solution."

The major drawback is that it can be only mounted to one EC2 instance. This also means that it can't be shared between multiple pods."
