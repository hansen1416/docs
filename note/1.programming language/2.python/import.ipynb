    "When import, the first thing Python will do is look up the name abc in sys.modules. This is a cache of all modules that have been previously imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the name isn’t found in the module cache, Python will proceed to search through a list of built-in modules. These are modules that come pre-installed with Python and can be found in the Python Standard Library. If the name still isn’t found in the built-in modules, Python then searches for it in a list of directories defined by sys.path. This list usually includes the current directory, which is searched first.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python finds the module, it binds it to a name in the local scope. This means that abc is now defined and can be used in the current file without throwing a NameError.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the name is never found, you’ll get a ModuleNotFoundError. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Imports should always be written at the top of the file, after any module comments and docstrings.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Imports should be divided according to what is being imported. There are generally three groups:  \n",
    "   - standard library imports (Python’s built-in modules)\n",
    "   - related third party imports (modules that are installed and do not belong to the current application)\n",
    "   - local application imports (modules that belong to the current application)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. Each group of imports should be separated by a blank space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*It’s also a good idea to order your imports alphabetically within each import group. This makes finding particular imports much easier, especially when there are many imports in a file.*\n",
