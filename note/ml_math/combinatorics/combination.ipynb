For this in it enough to pick 3 positions for red balls out of 6 possibilities, we can do it in (63)\\binom{6}{3}(36​) ways. Next, we need to place blue balls between red and green. There are 7 possible locations and we need to pick 3 out of them for the blue balls. We can do it in (73)\\binom{7}{3}(37​) ways. By the rule of product we have (63)×(73)=700\\binom{6}{3}\\times \\binom{7}{3} = 700(36​)×(37​)=700 possibilities."

How many ways do we have to do it.\n",

    "This is correct! A simple way to see this is the following. For each set with the property in the formulation consider another set constructed as follows: include in the new set all mathematicians that were in our set and all data scientists that were not in our set. Observe that the new set is of size 4. Observe, that we can perform the reverse operation: start with the set of 4 people, remove all data scientists, include all data scientists that were not in the set. This way we obtain the subset with equal number of mathematicians and data scientists. So, the operation we performed is invertible and the sets we are interested in are in one to one correspondence with subsets of size 4. So, the number of subsets we are interested in is (84)=70\\binom{8}{4}=70(48​)=70."

    "\n",
    "This is correct. Note that we are multiplying three brackets and to obtain x10x^{10}x10 we need to pick xpx^pxp from the first bracket, xqx^qxq from the second bracket and xrx^rxr from the third in such a way that p+q+r=10p+q+r=10p+q+r=10. So the coefficient of x10x^{10}x10 is equal to the number of solutions of this equation in non-negative integer numbers. As we have seen in one of the previous problems, the number of solutions is (122)=66\\binom{12}{2} = 66(212​)=66."
