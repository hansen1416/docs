    "__Can the sum of 2 non-differentiable functions be differentiable?__\n",
    "\n",
    "You can construct trivial cases where they are differentiable:\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if  f(x)  is a non-differentiable function, and  g(x)=xâˆ’f(x)  is another function, then  g(x)  must also be non-differntiable, since differentiation is a linear operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the sum  f(x)+g(x)=x , which is definitely a differentiable function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we can show that the inverse of the statement is false - i.e. __the sum of 2 non-differentiable functions is not necessarily non-differentiable in and of itself.__\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are obviously combinations which are not trivial in the same way as the above - for example if we had constructed  g(x)=x+f(x) , then that particular sum gives  f(x)+g(x)=x+2f(x).  Again, by using the argument that the differential operator is linear, we can again conclude that this is non-differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the answer is that is possible to construct both non-differentiable and differentiable functions from such a sum."
