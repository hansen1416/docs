    "We can say that vegetable consumption, in this case, is just a proxy for healthy lifestyle, but it does not change the health itself, it just gives us information about the lifestyle. If some person do not have healthy lifestyle, for example, they do not visit doctors and they do not do other things that are usually do people with healthy lifestyle and we say them that they have to consume more vegetables. They will increase in the value of this variable but it will not increase their health index, because the reason of large health index of people who consume more vegetables are not vegetables themselves, but this healthy lifestyle. This is also possible explanation which is consistent with this data. \n",

    "\n",
    "Anyway, correlation is a good measure of association between variables, but we have to understand and that this association is of observation nature. Then if we do some measure learning and we are interested only in predictions, we want to predict the health index and we use information about vegetable consumption and we know that there is a correlation, we can use correlation to make these predictions. \n",

    "But if we want to interfere, if we want to make a decisions like what our parameters should be changed to achieve a particular goal, we have to make a more complicated causal analysis. Anyway, correlations are important when we are interested in the association between two variables, but basic correlation that we discussed before is well-suited for linear relationship."
