    "The major reason that the generlized means are of interest to us here is that they are more suitable for \"sensitivity analysis\" than the min or max functions. We propose that $\\partial M_p(a) / \\partial a_i$ for large *p* is a more useful quantity than $\\partial max(a) / \\partial a_i$ since the latter is zero unless $a_i$ is maximum, in which case it is one. This discontinuous  behavior is awkward to work with, where as the partial derivative is continuous. We also note that the partial derivative ranges in value from 0 to $n^{-1/p} \\; \\approx \\; 1 \\; for \\; p \\gg ln \\; n $ \n",

    "- A heuristic method is usually based on a \"static evaluation function\" $\\hat{v}$ that gives a estimate $\\hat{v}(a)$ of the backed-up value v(c) for a nonterminal node c. The estimate is based on \"static\" feature of the current  configuration that can be evaluation without further look-ahead.\n",
