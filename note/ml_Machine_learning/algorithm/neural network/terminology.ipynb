    "The term \"batch\" is ambiguous: some people use it to designate the entire training set, and some people use it to refer to the number of training examples in one forward/backward pass (as I did in this answer). To avoid that ambiguity and make clear that batch corresponds to the number of training examples in one forward/backward pass, one can use the term <strong>mini-batch</strong>."
