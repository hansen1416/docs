    "_linear probing_ when you want to insert an element into your hash table, if that space is already taken, you have some probe sequence in which you check the following elements, if there are free or not. If you find an empty space, you just put your elements there. So linear probing is when you have some fixed interval, usually, just one is used. So you tried to put the element into your hash table, if that space is taken, you check the next one, if it's taken, you check the next one and so on.  \n",

    "_Quadratic probing_ is when interval between probes increases quadratically. So first, you check the next one, then you check the element after four elements and so on.\n",

    "_Double hashing_ is when the interval of your lookup is computed using the second hash function. It's actually the best approach for those three.\n",

    "So what is the downside of this method of collision resolution? Well, when you want to delete an element, it becomes rather tricky, because you need to remember that there was an element here and you mark it deleted, so when you look up for the element that was inserted after this one, you just don't stop and say that it's not there, you keep going."
