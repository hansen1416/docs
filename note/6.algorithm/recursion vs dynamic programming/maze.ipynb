    "What happens is the computer \"remembers\" all the \"what ifs\". What if I take the first door, what if I take the second door, what if I take the next door, etc. And for every possible door you can move through, the computer remembers those what ifs, and for every door after that, and after that, etc, until the end is found.\n",
