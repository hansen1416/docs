    "Well, you can just start with an empty one and then add elements one after another. But well, that's another best way to do it, you can actually just put your elements in the integer array without worrying about the relationship between the parents and the children and then you can call sift-up from each one of them. So first from the first ones, from the second, from the third, and so on. You can construct your heap in such a fashion until it will actually be more efficient than to construct it using just adding elements to your empty heaped one after another."
