    "You are tasked with developing a movie recommendation system. You are given a list of movies (their names) and a list of similarities between movies (pairs of movies that are similar). You are also given a list of user's friends and for each friend a list of movies that he has already seen.\n",

Uniqueness is 1 divided by the mean number of similar movies that the user's friends have already seen. So you should return the film with the highest number: F / S, where F = number of friends who have seen this movie, and S = mean of the number of similar movies seen for each friend."
