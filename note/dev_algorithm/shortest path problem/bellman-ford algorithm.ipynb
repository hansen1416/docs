So, each shortest path has $|V^{*}|$ vertices and $|V^{*} - 1|∣$ edges (depending on which vertex we are calculating the distance for). More generally, $|V^{*}| \\leq |V|$, so each path has $\\leq |V|$ vertices and $\\leq |V^{*} - 1|$ edges.\n",

    "  iteration, all we're doing is comparing $v.distance + weight(u, v)$ to $u.distance$e. All that can possibly happen is that $u.distance$ gets smaller. So, after the $i^\\text{th}$  iteration, $u.distance$ is at most the distance from $s$ to $u$.
