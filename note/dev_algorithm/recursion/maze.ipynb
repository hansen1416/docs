    "For every door in the current room, if the door leads to the exit, take that door.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"trick\" here is of course, how do we know if the door leads to a room that leads to the exit? The answer is we don't but we can let the computer figure it out for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the recursive part about the above algorithm? Its the \"door leads out of the maze\". How do we know if a door leads out of the maze? We know because inside the next room (going through the door), we ask the same question, how do we get out of the maze?\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens is the computer \"remembers\" all the \"what ifs\". What if I take the first door, what if I take the second door, what if I take the next door, etc. And for every possible door you can move through, the computer remembers those what ifs, and for every door after that, and after that, etc, until the end is found.\n",
