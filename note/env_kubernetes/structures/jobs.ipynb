If a node failure occurs and the pod is lost, the job controller is aware that the task has not been completed. The _job controller_ reschedules the job pod to run on a different node. The _job controller_ continues to monitor the pod until the task completes. When the task has completed, the _job controller_ removes the finished job and any pods associated with it.\n",
