    "A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, __it's ephemeral, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts__. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too.\n",

The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. __Volumes can not mount onto other volumes or have hard links to other volumes__. Each Container in the Pod must independently specify where to mount each volume."

Containers in the Pod can all read and write the same files in the `emptyDir` volume, though that volume can be mounted at the same or different paths in each Container. When a Pod is removed from a node for any reason, the data in the `emptyDir` is deleted forever.\n",

While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Containerâ€™s memory limit.\n",
