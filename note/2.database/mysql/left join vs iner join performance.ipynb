In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (`LEFT JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN`) has to do all the work of an `INNER JOIN` plus the extra work of null-extending the results. It would also be expected to return more rows, further increasing the total execution time simply due to the larger size of the result set.\n",
