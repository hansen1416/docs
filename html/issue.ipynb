    "The character in question &#65279 is the Unicode Character 'ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE' (U+FEFF). It may be that you copied it into your code via a copy/paste without realizing it. The fact that it's not visible makes it hard to tell if you're using an editor that displays actual unicode characters.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "One option is to open the file in a very basic text editor that doesn't understand unicode, or one that understands it but has the ability to display any non-ascii characters using their actual codes.\n",

    "Once you locate it, you can delete the small block of text around it and retype that text manually.\n",
