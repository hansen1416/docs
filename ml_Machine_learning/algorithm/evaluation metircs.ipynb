    "\n",
    "“My identifier doesn’t have great recall, but it does have good precision. That means that whenever a POI gets flagged in my test set, I know with a lot of confidence that it’s very likely to be a real POI and not a false alarm. On the other hand, the price I pay for this is that I sometimes miss real POIs, since I’m effectively reluctant to pull the trigger on edge cases.”\n",

    "My identifier has a really great F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the best of both worlds. Both my false positive and false negative rates are low, which means that I can identify POI’s reliably and accurately. If my identifier finds a POI then the person is almost certainly a POI, and if the identifier does not flag someone, then they are almost certainly not a POI.”\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s usually a tradeoff between precision and recall--which one do you think is more important in your POI identifier? There’s no right or wrong answer, there are good arguments either way, but you should be able to interpret both metrics and articulate which one you find most important and why."
