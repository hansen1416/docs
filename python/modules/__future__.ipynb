    "- To avoid confusing existing tools that analyze import statements and expect to find the modules they’re importing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To ensure that future statements run under releases prior to 2.1 at least yield runtime exceptions (the import of __future__ will fail, because there was no module of that name prior to 2.1).\n",

    "- To document when incompatible changes were introduced, and when they will be — or were — made mandatory. This is a form of executable documentation, and can be inspected programmatically via importing __future__ and examining its contents."
